		<p>In my current work at <a href="http://www.fourpeaksenv.com" target="_blank">Four Peaks Environmental Science and Data Solutions</a>, I build and manage data systems, conduct analyses, write reports, and manage projects, working closely with clients to design solutions that will meet their needs within time and budget constraints. For example, to support an <a href="https://fortress.wa.gov/ecy/ezshare/wq/standards/ChelanUAA.pdf" target="_blank">evaluation of attainable uses of the Chelan River</a>, I compiled data, developed figures, and conducted analyses, including a bootstrap analysis to evaluate tempearture increases within the river. My work in other projects includes managing data in MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server databases, developing and maintaining Shiny web applications, and developing Python scripts and Amazon Web Services pipelines to automate the transformation of raw data files into a standard format.</p>

		<h3>Bio-economic model of marine recreational fisheries off Washington and Oregon</h3>

		<p>I developed a bio-economic model of marine recreational fisheries off Washington and Oregon while working as a contractor at the <a href="http://www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/" target="_blank">NOAA Fisheries Northwest Fisheries Science Center</a>. Recreational fisheries make up a substantial portion of catch for many West Coast fish stocks and are economically, socially, and culturally important. It is difficult to predict how changes in recreational fisheries regulations (e.g. bag limits, size limits, seasonal closures) will influence recreational angler effort and recreational fishing mortality for both targeted and bycatch stocks. To better understand this and promote informed management decisions, my colleagues and I built a bio-economic simulation model of marine groundfish and salmon recreational fisheries off Washington and Oregon. I collaborated with stakeholders from the fishing industry, state agencies, and NOAA to ensure the model would be relevant to management decisions. I compiled data from many different sources and summarized and analyzed the data for inclusion in the simulation model, including zero-inflated negative binomial modeling of catch-per-trip and probability distribution analysis of catch-by-length.</p>
		<p>While working on this project, I also contributed to an assessment of the black rockfish stocks off Washington, Oregon, and California and helped present the assessment model to reviewers and stakeholders at a stock assessment review meeting.</p>

		<h3>Environmental influences on Arctic-Yukon-Kuskokwim Chinook salmon survival</h3>

		<p>There have been dramatic declines in the number of adult Chinook salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</em>) returning to the Arctic-Yukon-Kuskokwim region of western Alaska in recent decades. To better understand the causes of these poor returns, I studied how freshwater and ocean environmental conditions impact their survival. I compiled relevant environmental data (e.g. river flow, air temperature, sea surface temperature) from many sources and developed models (e.g., linear mixed models) to identify processes and variables important to Chinook salmon survival in this region.</p>

		<p>Understanding environmental influences on marine fish productivity is important for sustainable, ecosystem-based management of marine resources. This knowledge is particularly important for early life stages when fish are most sensitive to changes in the environment. I investigated the hypothesis that groups of Northeast Pacific marine fish stocks exhibit synchronous recruitment (the number of fish spawned in a certain year as they reach an age that they are susceptible to fishing) due to a shared susceptibility to environmental influences. I investigated the effects of regional environmental variables such as water temperature, freshwater runoff, and upwelling. I used Bayesian hierarchical models to model recruitment for groups of stocks with similar early life histories as a function of these environmental covariates. This research was part of my Master's thesis at the University of Washington <a href="http://fish.washington.edu" target="_blank">School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences</a>. I shared the results of this work through a <a href="papers/Linking Northeast Pacific recruitment synchrony to environmental variability.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> and presentations at several scientific and fishery management meetings.</p>
		<p>I also contributed to several related projects, inculding an <a href="papers/Ecosystem effects of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation.pdf" target="_blank">analysis and summary of the ecosystem effects of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation</a> and a <a href="papers/Reproductive resilience a paradigm shift in understanding spawner-recruit systems in exploited marine fish.pdf" target="_blank">study of the reproductive resilience of marine fish stocks and ways to account for this in assessment and management</a>.</p>
		<p>To learn more about Northeast Pacific fish species I participated in many field surveys, including an <a href="http://www.afsc.noaa.gov/Quarterly/jas2011/divrptsRACE9.htm" target="_blank">acoustic-trawl survey</a> of walleye pollock in the Gulf of Alaska during the summer of 2011.</p>

		<p>I utilized multivarate statistics (e.g., principal component analysis) to identify common patterns of variation in the abundance of wild pink salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus gorbuscha</em>), chum salmon (<em>O. keta</em>), and sockeye salmon (<em>O. nerka</em>) from 34 population groups from Asia and western North America using multivariate analysis techniques. I also identified oceanographic and atmospheric variables that covary with the major patterns of salmon abundance variations.

		<p>The aim of this project was to determine the bycatch discard mortality rate of Alaska sablefish (<em>Anoplopoma fimbria</em>) and factors affecting mortality for use in stock assessments to better inform management decisions. I compiled information for over 10,000 tagged sablefish and conducted a statistical analysis of relative recapture rates based on several factors using a logistic regression.
